## Brief

We have been commissioned to build a travel community, code-named **Project Wayfarer** for now, for users to share tips (AKA posts) about their favorite locations around the world.

## Client Contract

The client has provided basic wireframes and user stories. In some cases, these requirements may be vague or incomplete.

* [Wireframes](./wireframes.png)
* [User Stories](./user-stories.md)

## Process

The client contract consists of three core sprints and a bonus. Each sprint contains a set of user stories. You may not complete all of the sprints within the time period, and that's ok. **The goal is to gain experience working on a development project in a group while navigating a client's feature list.**

**IMPORTANT:** You will not begin a new sprint or start on a bonus without completing the previous sprint.

You will work in groups of 2-4, and we expect you to **pair program** for the majority of the time you're writing code.

Commit changes at least once for each user story. Put effort into your **design**. Use a CSS framework (e.g. Bootstrap or Materialize), partials, and some custom CSS or Sass/Less.

Work as **[git collaborators](./git-collaboration-workflow.md), build on feature branches, and submit pull requests for approval and merging**.

After you have completed your project, **deploy to heroku (optional)** to get practice getting the app online. The earlier you resolve deployment, the easier it will be to fix bugs.

**Refactor** your code after each sprint, considering:

* Indentation
* Readability/clarity
* Naming
* Organization
* Commenting
* DRYness

## Questions to Ask Yourselves

1. **Are you all clear about what the client wants?** Identify vague areas. Seek clarification in any cases where you feel less confident about your interpretation of the client's vision.

2. **What will the UX/UI flow be?** Hammer out any areas of ambiguity in the wireframes

3. **What are the major milestones or components that you need to complete?** How can these be turned into tasks that group members can complete in pairs? Where do these milestones overlap and how will those related tasks be managed?

4. **What milestones are you and your group members interested in working on?** How can you effectively delegate the work into pairs so that each group member is interested, challenged, and productive?

## Presentation

Each group will present their project at the end of the activity for **5-10 minutes**.

Each member of your group should speak for equal parts during your presentation and mention which parts of the project they worked on.

**Your presentation should include:**

* Tour (demo) of your app, ideally deployed on heroku (but not required).
* How did your group approach the requirements? (mention anything unique or creative your group chose to do)
* What was easier than you thought? What was more challenging?
* What is a lesson you will carry forward to working on your next project?
* Shout outs for fellow students!
